\chapter{Online Resources}~\label{Appendix:A}
\section{Examples Source Code}
All the examples presented throughout the Tutorial are available online at 
\iftoggle{cpp}{
	\url{https://github.com/kydos/dds-tutorial-cpp}.
}

The \texttt{README.md} provides all the information necessary to install and run 
the examples.


\section{Getting a DDS Implementation}
\iftoggle{cpp}{
At the time of writing, the only open source, as well as commercial, \ac{DDS} implementation
that supports the new C++ API is \href{http://www.opensplice.org/}{OpenSplice DDS} which is 
freely available at \url{http://www.opensplice.org}.
}


\section{C++11 Considerations}
Although some of the examples in this tutorial take advantage of C++11, the new \ac{DDS} C++ API can also be used with C++03 compilers. 
That said, should you have possibility of using a C++11 compiler, then there are 
some additional aspects of the language that can be enabled. If you are interested in
learning more take a look at the following GitHub project \url{https://github.com/kydos/dds-cpp11}
